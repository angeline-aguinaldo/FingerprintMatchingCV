# FingerprintMatchingCV
This project includes code used to matching fingerprints against a database of fingerprints using image segmentation, fiducial identification, invariant relationships, and affine transformations.

## Getting started

To run a demo of this software, download the repo and run the FingerprintMatchingCV_RunMe.m

## Pre-requisites

Prior to running the FingerprintMatchingCV_RunMe.m file, you must: 
- Install MATLAB 2014b or greater

## Demo

To run the demo,
<p>1. Run the FingerprintMatchingCV_RunMe.m</p>
<p>2. Select all the images to be included in the database of fingerprint references.</p>
<p>3. Select all sample images to be compared.</p>
<p>4. Figure pairings with fiducial points and segmenetation and error rates will display.</p>
