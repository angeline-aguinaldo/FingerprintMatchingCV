# FingerprintMatchingCV
This project includes code used to matching fingerprints against a database of fingerprints using image segmentation, fiducial identification, invariant relationships, and affine transformations.

## Getting started

To run a demo of this software, download the repo and run the FingerprintMatchingCV_RunMe.m

## Pre-requisites

Prior to running the FingerprintMatchingCV_RunMe.m file, you must: 
- Install MATLAB 2014b or greater

## Demo

To run the demo,
1. Run the FingerprintMatchingCV_RunMe.m
2. Select all the images to be included in the database of fingerprint references.
3. Select all sample images to be compared.
4. Figure pairings with fiducial points and segmenetation and error rates will display.
